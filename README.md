# tennis-analysis-project

The inspiration for this project stems from my short-lived dream of being a professional tennis player in my teenage years.

I have taken the data of tennis matches dating all the way from the start of 2010 and analyzed data providing insights into every player's match statistics who were active at the time. This project provides a backdoor to look at that data with the option to choose between looking at just the Big 4 (players who dominated Men's Tennis at the time) - Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal, Roger Federer, and Andy Murray, the rest of the players on tour, or both the groups.

For the purpose of this project, I have used SQL to manipulate data using joins, aggregate functions, and case statements. After that, I exported that data to Excel to make use of Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts providing limited functionality to look at different angles. I then exported that same resultset to a Data Visualization Tool - Tableau. I leveraged Tableau to give the user more functionality than Excel allowed. I gave them the option to enter the Top N amount of players from every single stat that was available to me.

Hope this provides some insight into tennis player's stats and maybe also learn more about your favorite tennis player.
